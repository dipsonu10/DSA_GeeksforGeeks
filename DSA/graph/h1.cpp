/*Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm for Maximum Flow Problem
Difficulty Level : Hard
Last Updated : 04 Mar, 2021
 
Given a graph which represents a flow network where every edge has a capacity. Also given two vertices source ‘s’ and sink ‘t’ in the graph, find the maximum possible flow from s to t with following constraints:
a) Flow on an edge doesn’t exceed the given capacity of the edge.
b) Incoming flow is equal to outgoing flow for every vertex except s and t.
For example, consider the following graph from CLRS book. 

ford_fulkerson1

The maximum possible flow in the above graph is 23. 
Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm 
The following is simple idea of Ford-Fulkerson algorithm:
1) Start with initial flow as 0.
2) While there is a augmenting path from source to sink. 
           Add this path-flow to flow.
3) Return flow.*/
